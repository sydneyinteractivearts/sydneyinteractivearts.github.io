          <h2>
            Welcome to the inaugural Sydney Interactive Arts Meetup!  
          </h2>
          <p>
          This is a monthly meetup of discussion and collaboration opportunities for all things Interactive Art. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome creatives; makers; artists; creative coders; anyone really, who is interested in exploring the intersection of art and technology. We'll be hosting drinks, talks, workshops, show & tell sessions, and more!
          </p>
          <p>
          Our format will be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hellos, drinks and snacks</li>
            <li>1 to 2 short talks on topics ranging from project case studies to latest technologies.</li>
            <li>Members show & tell: Show off your latest hack, or tell the room about the awesome new productivity technique you discovered last weekend!</li>
            <li>Project time: Bring your project to the meetup and hack away with like minded people. Begin a collaboration, get help solving a problem, or contribute to someone else’s project!</li>
            <li>We are pretty casual here—feel free to come and go anytime during the meet.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Join our Facebook group to follow and share inspirational projects you see (Facebook group coming soon).
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            FAQ
          </h2>
          <h3>
            What kind of projects?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our members are a varied bunch of creatives, programmers, designers, illustrators, engineers etc. So really, any project in the realm of Interactive Art is considered fair game here. Many, if not all, projects will have a programming aspect to them. Do you have a problem with your project you need help to solve? Do you have an idea for a killer interactive artwork but limited programming experience to have it realised? Then come along, link up with like minded people, learn and collaborate!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Who we are
